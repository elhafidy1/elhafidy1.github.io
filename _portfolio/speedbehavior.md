**SpeedBehavior** is an evidence-based mobile application designed to promote
adherence to speed limits among Moroccan drivers.

The application is grounded in behavioral theories, particularly the
**Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)**, and integrates validated
**Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs)**.
