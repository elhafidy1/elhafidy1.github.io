**Trust in Internet of Things (IoT)** is an academic project focused on the study
and simulation of **trust management** in IoT networks.

## 📌 Project overview
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that connects physical devices
equipped with sensors, software, and communication capabilities, enabling data exchange
and interoperability. IoT applications range from simple home automation systems to
complex, interconnected smart city infrastructures.

Despite its rapid growth, IoT faces significant security challenges, particularly
regarding **trust management**. Unlike wireless sensor networks, IoT lacks a
standardized and established framework for evaluating trust among heterogeneous and
dynamic devices.

## 🔬 Research contribution
This project addresses the challenge of trust management in IoT by:
- Analyzing existing trust models in related domains
- Identifying limitations of current IoT trust mechanisms
- Proposing a trust-based approach adapted to IoT environments

## 🧪 Simulation and implementation
A **Trust-based Intrusion Detection System (T-IDS)** was designed and implemented.
Each node observes and evaluates the behavior of its neighbors based on their compliance
with the **RPL routing protocol**.

Observed behavior is sent to a centralized node for analysis using:
- Belief
- Disbelief
- Uncertainty

These metrics are used to evaluate:
- Number of detected malicious nodes
- Energy consumption
- Memory usage

## 🔑 Keywords
Internet of Things (IoT), trust, trust management, intrusion detection, RPL protocol, IoT security
