I am a **PhD in Computer Science** with a research focus on **Software Engineering, Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence**, with a particular emphasis on **human behavior intervention in the road safety domain**.

My work investigates human behavior using the **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)** and **behavior change techniques (BCTs)**, and explores the design of **mobile and data-driven interventions** to improve **compliance with road regulations**, particularly in **developing countries**.

My research combines behavioral modeling, statistical analysis, and mobile technologies to address real-world road safety challenges, with a special focus on speeding behavior and preventive digital solutions.
