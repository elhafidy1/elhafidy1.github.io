This paper presents the usability assessment of a
mobile application for promoting adherence to speed limits. Grounded in behavioral science, the app used several Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) to address the social and psychological factors associated with speeding. To assess the usability of the developed mobile application, the ISO 9241-11 standard was adopted. A set of usage scenarios was conducted with participants from the field of computer science, enabling the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. The assessment focused on three usability metrics: effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Participants also provided constructive feedback for enhancing the app's interface and overall user experience.
