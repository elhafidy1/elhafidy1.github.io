Speeding remains a critical factor contributing to
road crashes. Therefore, understanding drivers’ intentions to speed is crucial for designing effective interventions helping drivers to respect speed limit on road. Demographic and psychological factors are widely used to explain several human behaviors. However, their predictive power change in relation to the kind of targeted behavior. Moreover, many studies consider psychological factors as primary contributors to behaviors and intentions and consider demographics variables as background factors. This paper investigates the predictive power of demographic and psychological factors using machine learning algorithms to predict drivers speeding intentions. A survey based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was conducted to collect data about the speeding intention of 254 drivers in Morocco. The survey includes questions about demographic and psychological factors. Five machine learning algorithms were used to assess the accuracy of speeding prediction with the combination background and psychological factors. Also, the correlation between all variables was assessed. Finally, a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to have a deep understanding of speeding intention. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering demographic features as background factors when predicting the intention to speed, using psychological factors. Moreover, the study underlines the potential of the TPB in the understanding of speeding intention. Overall, the findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop interventions aimed at combating speeding behavior and promoting safer driving practices.
